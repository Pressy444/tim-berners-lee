      <h1><strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong></h1>
      <h3>British scientist</h3>
<p>Tim Berners-Lee, in full Sir Tim Berners-Lee, 
  (born June 8, 1955, London, England), British  
  computer scientist, generally credited as the  
  inventor of the World Wide Web. In 2004 he was 
  awarded a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II of 
  the United Kingdom and the inaugural Millennium  
  Technology Prize (€1 million) by the Finnish  
  Technology Award Foundation.</p>
<p>Computing came naturally to Berners-Lee, as  
  both of his parents worked on the Ferranti  
  Mark I, the first commercial computer.  
  (See computer: The first stored-program 
  machines.) After graduating in 1976 from  
  the University of Oxford, Berners-Lee designed 
  computer software for two years at Plessey  
  Telecommunications Ltd., located in Poole, 
  several positions in the computer industry, 
  including a stint from June to December 1980 as  
  a software engineering consultant at CERN, the  
  European particle physics laboratory in Geneva.</p>

  <p>While at CERN, Berners-Lee developed a program
    for himself, called Enquire, that could store 
    information in files that contained connections 
    (“links”) both within and among separate files—a 
    technique that became known as hypertext. 
    After leaving CERN, Berners-Lee worked for Image
    Computer Systems Ltd., located in Ferndown, Dorset, 
    where he designed a variety of computer systems. 

  

    In 1984 he returned to CERN to work on the design 
    of the laboratory’s computer network, developing 
    procedures that allowed diverse computers to 
    communicate with one another and researchers to 
    control remote machines. In 1989 Berners-Lee drew 
    up a proposal for creating a global hypertext
    document system that would make use of the Internet.
    His goal was to provide 
 
 
    researchers with the ability to share their results, techniques, and practices without
    having to exchange e-mail constantly. Instead, researchers would place such information 
    “online,” where their peers could immediately retrieve it anytime, day or night. Berners-Lee 
    wrote the software for the first Web server (the central repository for the files to be shared) 
    and the first Web client, or “browser” (the program to access and display files retrieved from 
    the server), between October 1990 and the summer of 1991. The first “killer application” of the 
    Web at CERN was the laboratory’s telephone directory—a mundane beginning for one of the 
    technological wonders of the computer age.</p>
  
 
  
  
 <p>From 1991 to 1993 Berners-Lee evangelized the Web. In 1994 in the United States he established
  the World Wide Web (W3) Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Laboratory for 
  Computer Science. The consortium, in consultation with others, lends oversight to the Web and the 
  development of standards. In 1999 Berners-Lee became the first holder of the 3Com Founders chair 
  at the Laboratory for Computer Science. His numerous other honours included the National Academy of 
  Engineering’s prestigious Charles Stark Draper Prize (2007). Berners-Lee was the author, along with 
  Mark Fischetti, of Weaving the Web: The Original Design and Ultimate Destiny of the World Wide Web (2000).</p>
