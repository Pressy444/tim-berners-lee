      <h1>Tim Berners-Lee</h1>
      <h3>British scientist</h3>
<p>Tim Berners-Lee, in full Sir Tim Berners-Lee,<br> 
  (born June 8, 1955, London, England), British <br>
  computer scientist, generally credited as the <br>
  inventor of the World Wide Web. In 2004 he was <br>
  awarded a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II of <br>
  the United Kingdom and the inaugural Millennium <br>
  Technology Prize (€1 million) by the Finnish <br>
  Technology Award Foundation.</p>
<p>Computing came naturally to Berners-Lee, as <br>
  both of his parents worked on the Ferranti <br>
  Mark I, the first commercial computer. <br>
  (See computer: The first stored-program <br>
  machines.) After graduating in 1976 from <br>
  the University of Oxford, Berners-Lee designed<br>
  computer software for two years at Plessey <br>
  Telecommunications Ltd., located in Poole,<br> 
  Dorset, England. Following this, he had <br>
  several positions in the computer industry,<br>
  including a stint from June to December 1980 as <br>
  a software engineering consultant at CERN, the <br>
  European particle physics laboratory in Geneva.</p>

  
  <p>While at CERN, Berners-Lee developed a program<br> 
    for himself, called Enquire, that could store <br>
    information in files that contained connections <br>
    (“links”) both within and among separate files—a <br>
    technique that became known as hypertext. <br>
    After leaving CERN, Berners-Lee worked for Image<br> 
    Computer Systems Ltd., located in Ferndown, Dorset,<br> 
    where he designed a variety of computer systems. <br>
    In 1984 he returned to CERN to work on the design <br>
    of the laboratory’s computer network, developing <br>
    procedures that allowed diverse computers to <br>
    communicate with one another and researchers to <br>
    control remote machines. In 1989 Berners-Lee drew <br>
    up a proposal for creating a global hypertext <br>
    document system that would make use of the Internet.<br> 
    His goal was to provide <br>
    researchers with the ability to share their results, techniques, and practices without<br>
    having to exchange e-mail constantly. Instead, researchers would place such information <br>
    “online,” where their peers could immediately retrieve it anytime, day or night. Berners-Lee <br>
    wrote the software for the first Web server (the central repository for the files to be shared) <br>
    and the first Web client, or “browser” (the program to access and display files retrieved from <br>
    the server), between October 1990 and the summer of 1991. The first “killer application” of the <br>
    Web at CERN was the laboratory’s telephone directory—a mundane beginning for one of the <br>
    technological wonders of the computer age.</p>
